### Final Steps Before Making Public

1. **Review all recent commits** to ensure no sensitive data was accidentally committed
2. **Run a final security scan** using tools like:
   ```bash
   # Check for secrets
   git secrets --scan
   
   # Or use truffleHog
   trufflehog git file://./
   ```

3. **Test fresh installation** on a clean machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo>
   cd fusion-plus-xlm
   npm install
   # Follow setup instructions
   ```

4. **Update repository settings** on GitHub:
   - Add appropriate topics (stellar, ethereum, cross-chain, defi, 1inch)
   - Set up branch protection for main branch
   - Configure security alerts
   - Add a proper description

5. **Consider adding**:
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Issue templates
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Code of Conduct

## Post-Release Monitoring

- Monitor issues and pull requests
- Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Track API usage and rate limits
- Regular security updates for dependencies
