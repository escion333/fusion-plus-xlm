# Mainnet Deployment Checklist

## What's Ready for Mainnet Testing

### ✅ Completed Setup

1. **Stellar Contract** (DEPLOYED & VERIFIED)
   - Production Contract: `CBPL4TVZUM4TAHSRISO4CNNPWAIGMQLUN5MB4MDVZ5ZL3SRRTN56CVNG`
   - Successfully tested HTLC flow: `CBX3ET3JMZQCQF74YN2PR35ALF3EI73VMYWUX33WKTQMY62I2YR2YWFU`
   - Native XLM support via SAC: `CAS3J7GYLGXMF6TDJBBYYSE3HQ6BBSMLNUQ34T6TZMYMW2EVH34XOWMA`
   - Full HTLC implementation with 1inch compatibility
   - ✅ Verified: Complete deposit → lock → withdraw flow with real XLM
   
2. **Ethereum Integration**
   - Using 1inch's existing Escrow Factory: `0xa7bcb4eac8964306f9e3764f67db6a7af6ddf99a`
   - No additional contracts needed

3. **Environment Configuration** (CONSOLIDATED)
   - Single `.env` file (cleaned up from 4 files)
   - Production-ready configuration
   - Test wallet configured and funded

4. **Frontend & API Proxy**
   - Mainnet-ready configuration
   - Production build commands
   - 1inch API integration
   - Cross-chain swap UI functional

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Deploy Stellar Contract (need funded account)
./scripts/deploy-stellar-mainnet.sh YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME

# 2. Configure 1inch API
./scripts/setup-mainnet-api.sh

# 3. Test API Connection
node scripts/test-1inch-api.js

# 4. Build Project
npm run build

# 5. Start API Proxy
npm run proxy:prod

# 6. Deploy Frontend
cd frontend && vercel --prod
```

## Required Resources

- [x] 100+ XLM for Stellar deployment and operations (✅ Using 110 XLM test wallet)
- [ ] 0.1+ ETH for Ethereum gas fees
- [x] 1inch API key from https://portal.1inch.dev/ (✅ Configured in .env)
- [x] Test funds for swaps (✅ Successfully tested with 5 XLM)

## How Testing Works

1. **You provide liquidity** by creating swap orders
2. **1inch resolvers** compete to fill your orders
3. **Atomic swaps** execute across both chains
4. **You receive assets** on the destination chain

## Important Notes

- We're NOT running a resolver (1inch handles that)
- We're NOT deploying to Ethereum (using 1inch contracts)
- Start with SMALL amounts ($10-20) for safety
- Monitor gas costs carefully

## Safety Reminders

⚠️ **This is REAL MONEY on MAINNET**
- Double-check all addresses
- Start with minimal amounts
- Keep private keys secure
- Monitor transactions closely
