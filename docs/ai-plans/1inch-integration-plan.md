# 1inch Fusion+ Integration Plan

## üèÜ Hackathon Focus: Stellar Extension Demo

This plan focuses on demonstrating Stellar integration with 1inch Fusion+ for the hackathon by extending their cross-chain resolver example.

## Hackathon Objective

### Primary Goal
Build a compelling demo showing Ethereum ‚Üî Stellar cross-chain swaps by:
1. **Extending 1inch's resolver example** to support Stellar
2. **Using their mock relayer** with our resolver whitelisted
3. **Creating local orders** (no API access needed)
4. **Demonstrating on mainnet** for high impact

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Get 1inch example working locally (Ethereum ‚Üî BSC)
- [ ] Add Stellar support to their architecture
- [ ] Demo successful cross-chain swap
- [ ] Show innovative non-EVM integration
- [ ] Prepare impressive presentation

## Hackathon Approach

### What 1inch Provides
1. **Mock relayer** - They have one we can use
2. **Resolver whitelisting** - Our resolver can be added
3. **Example code** - Working Ethereum ‚Üî BSC implementation
4. **Local order creation** - No API needed

### Our Extension Strategy

### 1. Study & Run Their Example
**First Priority**: Get their code working

**Steps**:
```bash
# Clone and run their example
git clone https://github.com/1inch/cross-chain-resolver-example
cd cross-chain-resolver-example
npm install
npm test  # Ensure Ethereum ‚Üî BSC works
```

### 2. Add Stellar Support
**Main Task**: Extend to support Stellar

**Key Components**:
1. Stellar resolver contract (Soroban)
2. Stellar chain monitor
3. Address/asset mapping
4. Integration with mock relayer

### 3. Demo Flow
**Goal**: Show working cross-chain swap

**Steps**:
1. Create order locally with our resolver
2. Fill on Ethereum via their system
3. Deploy on Stellar via our extension
4. Complete swap successfully

## Hackathon Implementation Approach

### Extension Strategy
```typescript
// 1. Extend their existing classes
class ExtendedRelayer extends MockRelayer {
  private stellarMonitor: StellarMonitor;
  
  async handleOrder(order: CrossChainOrder) {
    if (order.dstChainId === STELLAR_CHAIN_ID) {
      return this.handleStellarDestination(order);
    }
    return super.handleOrder(order);
  }
}

// 2. Add Stellar-specific handling
class StellarMonitor {
  async deployEscrow(params: EscrowParams) {
    // Call Stellar resolver contract
  }
  
  async watchForEvents(contractId: string) {
    // Monitor Soroban events
  }
}
```

### Key Hackathon Deliverables
1. **Working Demo**: Ethereum ‚Üî Stellar swap
2. **Code Extension**: Their example + Stellar
3. **Mainnet Proof**: Real transactions
4. **Innovation**: First non-EVM integration
5. **Documentation**: Clear explanation

### Demo Requirements
1. **Use their infrastructure**: Mock relayer + example
2. **Local order creation**: No API needed
3. **Our resolver whitelisted**: In mock system
4. **Stellar contracts deployed**: On mainnet
5. **Successful swap shown**: Live or recorded
