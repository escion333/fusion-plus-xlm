About
1inch provides a suite of powerful tools that enable developers to build smooth DeFi experiences on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and beyond. Hackers can utilize our open-source SDKs, smart contract protocols, and robust APIs to build onchain applications. In this hackathon, we are giving builders three distinct challenges:
* Build applications with extensive use of 1inch API
* Extend our Limit Order protocol with creative trading strategies for users
* Expand the reach of 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) to one of the following EVM and non-EVM chains: Sui, Aptos, Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Doge/Litecoin, Tron, Ton, Monad, Near, Starknet, Cardano, Stellar, XRP Ledger, ICP, Tezos, Polkadot, EOS, or Cosmos.

1inch offers a variety of REST APIs that make building onchain applications simpler. Create a full dApp using as many 1inch APIs as possible.
Example integration points:
- Add swap functionality with one of our swap protocols (1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+), Intent-based Swap (Fusion), Classic Swap, or Limit Order protocol)
- Source onchain data using our data APIs (price feeds API, wallet balances API, token metadata API, and many more)
- Post transactions our Web3 API to interact with the blockchain
Qualification Requirements
- Application should use 1inch API as much as possible
- Consistent commit history should be in the GitHub project. No low or single-commit entries allowed!
