# Quick Test Checklist - Is The Project Working?

Copy and run these commands one by one. Check off each item that works:

## 1️⃣ Test #1: Stellar Contracts
```bash
cd stellar-fusion && cargo test
```
- [ ] ✅ Shows "14 passed; 0 failed" → **IT WORKS!**
- [ ] ❌ Shows any failures → Not working

## 2️⃣ Test #2: Frontend UI
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000
- [ ] ✅ See a swap interface → **IT WORKS!**
- [ ] ❌ Error or blank page → Not working

## 3️⃣ Test #3: API Proxy
```bash
npm run proxy:dev
```
In another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3002/health
```
- [ ] ✅ See `{"status":"ok","service":"1inch-proxy"}` → **IT WORKS!**
- [ ] ❌ Connection refused → Not working

## 4️⃣ Test #4: Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
- [ ] ✅ No errors, creates 'dist' folder → **IT WORKS!**
- [ ] ❌ Red errors → Not working

## 🎯 Final Score
- 4/4 checked = Project fully working!
- 3/4 checked = Project mostly working (normal for demo)
- 2/4 checked = Partial functionality
- Less than 2 = Something's wrong

## 🚨 Important Notes
- The "resolver" service might fail - this is EXPECTED (needs blockchain keys)
- Some warnings are normal for a demo project
- The UI and contracts are the most important parts

## 💡 What Each Part Does
1. **Stellar Contracts**: The blockchain logic for swaps
2. **Frontend UI**: What users see and interact with
3. **API Proxy**: Connects to 1inch services
4. **Build Test**: Ensures code is valid

If you get 3/4 or 4/4, the project is successfully demonstrating the concept!
